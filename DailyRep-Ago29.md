## **STATUS**
- I have started to make some modifications to the template.
- The profile part has been filled out, profile picture, colors and some data changed.
- The new changes are in the Monx13Portfolio repository.
- I did not see any new videos of the Fullstack Bootcamp course.

## **BLOCKERS**
- Since the template taken has existed in another repository, not all the files are completely uploaded.

- I have to reconfigure the hss key because it determines that there are no permissions for the public key.
