## **STATUS**
- I have made modifications to my template.

- Create a new project. I hope it works even if you have to install many libraries.

- In case it doesn't work I'll look for another template to edit.

- I added new sections in the components.

## **BLOCKERS**
- Due to the rain, the electricity was intermittent, so it can't go any further.
