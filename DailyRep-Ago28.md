## **STATUS**
- I started looking for a template to make my portfolio. I am trying to start a known template to configure it but it shows errors.
- I try to upload the base template to a new portfolio, so that when modifying it if there is an error, the mistake can be known.
- For changes the portfolio. Create a new Mox13Portfolio repository for the new changes.

- [Base Template: Portfolio](https://github.com/Monx13/Portfolio)

- [Monx13 Portfolio](https://github.com/Monx13/MonxPortafolio)

## **BLOCKERS**
- Since the template taken has existed in another repository, not all the files are completely uploaded.

- I have to reconfigure the hss key because it determines that there are no permissions for the public key.
