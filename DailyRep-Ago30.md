## **STATUS**
- I have made modifications to my template.

- New pages were created that describe my status. For each page I organized each file in a different folder to export it on the main page.

- I added status and I will begin to edit each page according to the section in question.
I added a download access of my CV in pdf.

- Fixed my problem with my github SSH key.

## **BLOCKERS**
- Due to the rain, the electricity was intermittent, so it can't go any further.

- I have to update the CRACO because it shows many critical errors.

- I propose as a solution to create a new project from scratch and transfer the files that I already have and merge everything, so that it is updated.
## **ANNEXES**
